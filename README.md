"No living creature, not even human, has achieved, in the centre of one's sphere, what the bee has achieved on her own: and if intelligence from another world were to descend and ask of the earth the most perfect creation, I would offer the humble comb of honey".

~Maurice Maeterlinck, 
The Life Of The Bee,
1924
